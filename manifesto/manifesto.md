The Manifesto of the Jainism Party

Work in progress ...

THINGS TO INCLUDE
1. The peaceful way in which Jains live their lives is a way of life Jains have chosen for themselves, it has not been imposed upon them by an occupying power. Throughout their long history they have always been very peaceful. They have no history of committing genocides or of stoning people to death.

So ... vote Jainism!
