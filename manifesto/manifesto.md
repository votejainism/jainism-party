The Manifesto of the Jainism Party

Work in progress ...

THINGS TO INCLUDE (besides the obvious things)
1. The peaceful way in which Jains live their lives is a way of life Jains have chosen for themselves, it has not been imposed upon them by an occupying power. Throughout their long history they have always been very peaceful. They have no history of committing genocides or of stoning people to death.
2. Past violence committed by cultures is sometimes dismissed as being a product of the times and not of the culture itself. A knowledge of Jainism and Jain history should help counter this.
3. Having a political party named Jainism helps promote awareness of Jainism in countries where it is relatively unknown.

So ... vote Jainism!
