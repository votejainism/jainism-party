I understand that at minimum a political party must consist of two people; the leader and an additional officer. My question is does this additional officer have to be a citizen of the United Kingdom? I'm interested in starting a political party.

Dear Ian White,

Thank you for your email.

There is no citizenship requirement for party officers.

To register a party, you will need to:
- Complete an application form.
- Provide a financial scheme that has been adopted by the party.
- Provide a constitution.
- Pay the non-refundable £150 submission fee.
- Fulfil the officer roles of party leader, treasurer, and nominating officer and have at least 2 people as officers. 

**It is important that you carefully read this email and the Commission’s [Introduction to registering a political party](http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/107680/intro-registration-rp.pdf) as well as our other [guidance on registering and maintaining a party](http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/i-am-a/party-or-campaigner/guidance-for-political-parties/registering-and-maintaining-a-party) in full before making an application.**  If an application is rejected for any reason, including not being completed properly, the £150 fee is non-refundable.

#### Legal obligations of a political party
A registered political party must comply with the controls and responsibilities set out in the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 (PPERA).  Failure to comply with the obligations may be a criminal offence which can attract prosecution or civil sanctions, including a fine. You can find our enforcement policy [here](http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/199703/April-2016-Enforcement-Policy.pdf). 

Before deciding to apply to register a political party, you should ensure you read the Commission’s [introductory guidance for party treasurers](http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0013/102262/intro-party-treasurer-rp.pdf) to get an overview of the obligations of a registered political party.

#### Application
If you wish to apply to register online you can do so by using our website [PEF Online](http://pefonline.electoralcommission.org.uk/Default.aspx). Here you can find guidance about [using PEF Online](http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/117799/sp-pefonline-rp-npc-rc.pdf). You can upload your constitution and financial scheme and you can pay the £150 when you submit your application. 

If you wish to register a political party by post, you will need to complete an application form, constitution, financial scheme, and provide a cheque payment to the Electoral Commission at the address provided below.  You can find paper application forms on our website here:
Form RP1GB: Application to register a political party in Great Britain (XLS)
Form RP1NI: Application to register a political party in Northern Ireland only (XLS)

The Commission assesses all applications to register a political party on a case by case basis carefully in line with the requirements of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 (PPERA).

Upon receipt of a complete application from a party, the Registration Team will assess whether or not the application complies with the requirements of PPERA.  Once the assessment is complete, it will be put to the Commission’s internal Approvals Board.  This Board is chaired by the Director of Political Finance and Regulation & Legal Counsel who takes the final decision on an application.

Please note that the Registration Team cannot guarantee or provide a definitive view on whether or not a proposed application will or will not be approved.  That is because the decision maker is the Director of Political Finance and Regulation & Legal Counsel and not the team.

We aim to let a party know the outcome of their application within 30 working days of receiving a complete application.  If the party is applying with a view to standing candidates at a specific election, please ensure the application is lodged well before the close of nominations deadline. 

#### Identity marks
In deciding on what party name, descriptions and emblems to apply to register, you should ensure that you read the Commission’s guidance on party names, descriptions and emblems.

To further inform your decision, you should also undertake a search of the register of party names, descriptions and emblems to determine if there are any similar identity marks on the register.  You can undertake that search here.

Please note that all applied-for descriptions must make the identity of the party clear.  For example, a way to do that is to include the party name in the description.

#### Financial scheme
To be registered a party must have adopted a financial scheme that demonstrates how the party will comply with the legal requirements of party and election finances under PPERA.  We produce a template scheme that you can use to create the party’s own financial scheme.  Please note that this is a template only and the scheme must accurately reflect the practices and arrangements of the party.

As part of the assessment process, a party may be asked to evidence how the party has adopted the financial scheme.  For example, a party may be asked about what procedures it has in place to deliver the obligations set out in its financial scheme.

Where a party is applying to register in both the Great Britain and Northern Ireland registers, the party’s financial scheme must show that the financial affairs of the party in Great Britain will be conducted separately from those of the party in Northern Ireland.

#### Constitution
The constitution must show the structure and organisation of a party.  In order to adequately show that, a party should as a minimum include the following details in the constitution:

- The constitution should reflect which register the party are applying to register in. Where a party is applying to register in both the Great Britain and Northern Ireland registers, the party’s financial scheme must show that the financial affairs of the party in Great Britain will be conducted separately from those of the party in Northern Ireland.  The constitution should also reflect that.
- The party’s aims and objectives.
- A reference to an intention to stand candidates and at which elections.
- The candidate selection process (or at least a statement that the party will have one).
- The structure of the party and who is responsible for managing the party, including the responsibility of the party officers, the terms of office and procedure for change of those officers.
- How the party will make and record decisions, as well as any other governance arrangements.  For example the frequency, timing and type of meetings and the quorum for meetings.
- If the party has membership, and if so the process and rules governing that membership.
- That the party have adopted its financial scheme.
- How the constitution can be changed and the process for dissolution of the party.

The constitution must also be consistent with a party’s financial scheme.
