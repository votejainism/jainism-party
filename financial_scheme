We understand that if our income or expenditure exceeds £250,000 our accounts must be submitted with an auditor’s certificate.

quarter 3 (1 July - 30 September) by 30 October of that year  
quarter 4 (1 October - 31 December) by 30 January of the following year

check the permissibility of any donations over £500 within 30 days of receipt  
  
ensure that impermissible or unidentifiable donations of more than £500 to the party are recorded as outlined above and returned to the sender or financial institution that transferred the money or, if that is not possible, surrendered to the Commission  
  
ensure that a submission of quarterly donation reports covering donations exceeding £7,500 (including aggregates of donations and regulated transactions) and any impermissible or anonymous donations of more than £500 is made to the Commission within the above timescales; submitting a nil return if there are no reportable donations  
  
provide weekly donation reports to the Commission during UK Parliamentary election campaigns if we are contesting the election  
  
1.11 We understand that if we submit four consecutive quarterly nil donation returns, we will then be exempt from submitting further quarterly returns in respect of donations until we receive a reportable donation.  
  
1.12 We also understand that separate quarterly donation returns must be submitted if we appear on the Northern Ireland register of political parties.
